# The-Assistant
Mobile Development project using Android Studio.

This project was part of the Mobile Development Course in my college.  It helps patients with Alzheimer's disease in the early stages of the disease.
The APP has a repository of registered people that interests the patient, such as family, friends and nurses. With a picture of the person the patient is seeing,
the APP uses an API to recognize the person and say their name and their relationship to the patient in the audio output.
The audio is in portuguese.
